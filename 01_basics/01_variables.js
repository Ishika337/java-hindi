const accountId = 144553
let accountEmail = "ishika@gmail.com" 
// var accountPassword = "12345"  using var is not a good practice insted use let or because of issue of block scope and functional scope
accountCity = "Jaipur"
//  let accountState ;  it will show undefined when we doesnot give them any value

// accountId = 2  not change as weassign it as const varable 

//  we can use let aur var for creating varibles delcaration

// console.log(accountId)
